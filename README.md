# Volume-Renderer
A basic Volume Renderer mainly for Medical Images like CT-Scans and MRI Images. Uses *Dear ImGui* for GUI and *stb_image_write* for saving images. The Volume Renderer is based on Direct Volume Ray Casting and uses GPU based raymarching. Currently no transfer functions are implemented however simple min/max values can be set to view a certain range of the values.
