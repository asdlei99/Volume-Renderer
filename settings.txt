#Settings file for Volume Renderer. The order of the options isn't necessary. If PVM file is given nothing else is needed.
#However if ".raw" file is provided, the user will have to provide the dimensions and the aspect-ratio as well.
#Empty options should be skipped along with the headers (pvm, raw, dimensions, aspect-ratio). If a header is provided and the 
#option is empty the program will throw an error. "#" is used for comments. An example is given below
